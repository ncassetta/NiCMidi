/// A MIDITickComponent implementing a metronome. You can select the port, channel and MIDI notes of the
/// metronome clicks; moreover you can have three types of click: the ordinary (beat) click, the measure click
/// (first beat of a measure) and a subdivision click. If you enable measure clicks the metronome can count the
/// measures and the beats of a measure (so you can represent them in a graphical interface).
/// When you change some parameter (tempo, measure, etc./) the metronome is not updated immediately, but only at
/// the subsequent click (see UpdateValues()).
/// \note Remember that you must call the MIDIManager::AddTick() to make effective the StaticTickProc(), then
/// you can call Start() and Stop() methods to enable or disable the thru.
