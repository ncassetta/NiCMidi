/// when the timer is started, a background thread is created for this task. You can set the timer
/// resolution in milliseconds (default is \ref DEFAULT_RESOLUTION) and the callback function.
/// Moreover, it provides some other timing utilities as static functions: you can stop a thread
/// for a given number of milliseconds and get the system time elapsed from the application
/// start.
/// The MIDIManager class embeds the MIDITimer, controlling its start and stop, so you probably
/// won't have to deal with it.
