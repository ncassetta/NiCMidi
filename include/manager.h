/// A static class that manages computer hardware resources (in and out MIDI ports) and timing.
/// It controls the MIDITimer object and embeds a MIDIInDriver or MIDIOutDriver for every hardware port;
/// moreover it manages a queue of MIDITickComponent (objects with a callback procedure to be called at regular
/// pace). When the timer is started the MIDIManager begins to call its main tick procedure at every timer tick;
/// this in turn calls the callback procedure of all the MIDITickComponent objects in the queue; typically
/// one of the MIDITickComponent is a sequencer, which can in this way pick the MIDI messages stored in its
/// internal MIDIMultiTrack object and send them to the out ports. You can add and remove other MIDITickComponent
/// objects with the AddMIDITick() and RemoveMIDITick() methods (for example you could add a MIDIThru or a
/// MIDIRecorder).
