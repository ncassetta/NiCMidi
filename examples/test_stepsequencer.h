   play                : Starts playback from current time\n\
   stop                : Stops playback\n\
   rew                 : Rewinds to the beginning of the file\n\
   goto meas [beat]    : Moves current time to given meas and beat\n\
                         (numbered from 1)\n\
   dump [trk]          : Prints a dump of all midi events in the file\n\
                         (or in the track trk)\n\
   notify on/off       : Sets events notifying during playback on or off\n\
   < [n]               : Moves current time n steps backward\n\
                         (if omitted, one step)\n\
   > [n]               : Moves current time n steps forward (as above)\n\
   t<                  : Moves insert position to previous track\n\
   t>                  : Moves insert position to next track\n\

                          them, or only vel, if they are the same)\n\
   volume val          : Inserts a volume event at current position\n\
   pan val             : Inserts a pan event at current position\n\
   control nn val      : Inserts a control nn event at current position\n\

   note nn *, volume *, etc... (followed by an asterisk)\n\
                       : Deletes the event (event must be at current time and track)\n\

   be                  : Marks block end\n\
   bcopy               : Copies the currently marked block into memory\n\
   bclear              : Clears all events in the currently marked block\n\
   bcut                : Deletes the currently marked block, shifting all subsequent\n\
                         events. This has no effect if a single track is marked\n\

                         from track num\n\
                         (if you specify \"o\" overwrites events, otherwise inserts them)\n\

   NOTE: when playing, the sequencer notifier will print beat messages,\n\
   messing up the program input prompt. You can turn it off with the ""notify""\n\
   command. However you can still type your commands during playback.\n\n";
